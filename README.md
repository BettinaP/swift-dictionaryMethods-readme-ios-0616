## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Update values within a dictionary using subscript syntax and `updateValue(_:forKey:)`.
* Understand that by accessing something within a dictionary using a key, you are getting back a Value.. but an Optional Value which requires you to unwrap it (check to see that it's not nil)
* Access a Value with a given Key, update that Value and reflect that update (change) back to the dictionary.
* Remove a Key Value pair setting the Value equal to nil with the provided Key.
* Remove a Key Value pair using the method `removeValueForKey()`
* Explain that by using `.count`, you will retrieve the total number of Key Value pairs within the dictionary.
* Explain that `.isEmpty` is a way to see if in fact the dictionary is empty, in that it returns a `Bool`, either `true` or `false` if the count is equal to 0.
* What `.keys` and `.values` does and how you can iterate over what this returns.

## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double, and Bool type.
* Can perform arithmetic operations on Int and Double.
* Understands if and else clause statements.
* Can create and use Arrays.
* Can iterate over an Array using a for-in loop.
* Can iterate over an Array calling enumerate().
* Work with the following methods on arrays:
	* append()
	* insert(_:atIndex:)
	* removeAtIndex()
	* subscript syntax with arrays
	* count
	* isEmpty
	* Optionals
* Can work with dictoinaries 
* Can iterate over a dictionary
* Knows about optionals (should at this point)

## Outline / Notes

* I've included a playground file which includes my notes in what I'm interested in covering for this particular lesson and how to go about it. I generally include those notes here but I found it easier doing in playground for this particular lesson.
