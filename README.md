> The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds the most discoveries, is not "Eureka!" (I found it!) but 'That's funny...'

## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Update values within a dictionary using subscript syntax and `updateValue(_:forKey:)`.
* Understand that by accessing something within a dictionary using a key, you are getting back a value, but it's an optional value which requires you to unwrap it.
* Access a value with a given key, update that value and reflect that update (change) back to the dictionary.
* Remove a key/value pair by assigning the value to `nil`.
* Remove a key/value pair using the method `removeValueForKey()`.
* Explain that by using `.count`, you will retrieve the total number of key/value pairs within the dictionary.
* Explain that `.isEmpty` is a way to see if in fact the dictionary is empty, in that it returns a `Bool`.
* What `.keys` and `.values` does and how you can iterate over what this returns.
